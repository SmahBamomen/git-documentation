## What is Git
if you understand the primary motive of Git ,and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you.

Before starting with the commands and operations let us first understand what is Git and the primary motive of Git.
Git is distributed version control tool that supports  distributed non-linear workflow by providing  data assurance for developing quality software.

The motive of Git is to manage a project or a set of files as they change over time. Git stores this information in a data structure called a Git repository. The repository is the core of Git.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time.

## What is repository?
To be very clear, a Git repository is the directory where all of your project files and the related metadata resides.
### types of repositories:
1. Central repository
2. Local repository

Git records the current state of the project by creating a tree graph from the index. It is usually in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

## Features of Git
1. Distributed
*  Allows distributed development of code 
* Every developer has local of copy the entire development history and changes are copied from one repository to another
2. Compatible
* Compatible with existing  systems protocols
3. Non-linear
* Supports non-linear development of software
4. Branching
* It takes only few seconds to create and merge branch
* Master or main branch always contains production quality code 
5. Lightweight
* Uses lossless compression technique to compress data on the client’s side
6. Speed
7. Open source
8. Reliable
* On events of system crash the lost data be easily recovered from Amy local repositories of the collaborators
9. Secure
10. Economical
* Releases under GPL’s license it is for free

## Operations & Commands
Some of the basic operations in Git are:
1. Initialize
2. Add
3. Commit
4. Pull
5. Push
Some advanced Git operations are:
1. Branching
2. Merging
3. Rebasing

Let me first give you a brief idea about how these operations work with the Git repositories. Take a look at the architecture of Git below:



If you understand the above diagram well and good, but if you don’t, you need not worry, I will be explaining these operations in this Git Tutorial one by one. Let us begin with the basic operations.
